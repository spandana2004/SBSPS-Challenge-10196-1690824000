## Introduction
This project aims to analyze trends in placement data using machine learning techniques. By examining historical placement records, we seek to identify factors influencing student placements and predict future placement.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical placement data to extract trends and patterns.
- Develop a predictive model to forecast future placements.
- Visualize key factors affecting placement rates.
- Provide insights for educational institutions to improve placement strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about student placements.

You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/code/bwandowando/students-employability-prediction-model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trend-in-placement.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd placement-trend-analysis
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the cells in the `Trend_in_Placement.ipynb` notebook to execute the analysis and view results.

## Results
The analysis reveals significant trends in placement data, including:
- Correlation between skills and placement rates.
- Impact of skills on placement opportunities.
- Prediction of placement.


## Future Work
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., internships, extracurricular activities) for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Develop a web application to visualize placement trends interactively.
